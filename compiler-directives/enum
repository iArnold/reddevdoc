ENUM
=====

An enum is a list of items that get numbered. This helps determining the items on the list.

The way ENUM works in the Red source is this.

#ENUM is a compiler-directive in the compiler.r script in /system/

In the function comp-directive it is declared in the switch.

#ENUM invokes the function proces-enum. 

In this function the enumerated list gets a place in memory and each of the items in the list gets a value assigned. 

When new items are added to the list or items get dropped or the order changes the items will get different numbers 
but this does not matter because whenever one of the items is used its value is really used and this value will 
be constant for this compilation.
