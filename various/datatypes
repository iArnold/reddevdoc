Datatypes

On 19 nov 2012 Jerry summed up the datatype in Red:

Now Red supports 21 datatypes. In the following R3 datatype list, 
datatypes with a minus prefix are not supported in Red yet.


action -binary -bitset block char -closure -command datatype -date 
-decimal -email -end -error -event -file -frame function get-path 
get-word -gob -handle -image integer -issue -library lit-path lit-word 
logic -map -module -money native none -object op -pair -paren path 
-percent -port -rebcode refinement set-path set-word string -struct 
-tag -task -time -tuple -typeset unset -url -utype -vector word

Doc replied the next day:
Jerry: command!, end!, frame! and rebcode! are very unlikely to be 
adopted in Red. Also following will probably not be part of Red too 
(or not in a near future): event!, gob!, handle!. Meaning of decimal! 
will most probably be changed, float! or real! will be used instead. 
Money! will receive a different treatment than in REBOL (number of 
digits after comma will probably be adjustable).


Also, expect the return of hash! in Red, and new datatypes that do 
not exists in REBOL.

As you can see, it is not a 1-1 matching between Red and R3.

March 9 2013 Doc mentions
I'm counting 27 datatypes implemented so far in Red. The next on 
the list will be: typeset!, errror!, object!, port!, binary!. Although, 
I'm not sure in which precise order they will be added (especially 
for error! and object!, not sure which one I'll do first).


For other datatypes, like float!, date! and time!, which are not 
a requirement for building Red core itself, I would like them to 
be contributed if possible. I could provide a sample empty datatype 
file and instructions on how to use Red's current internal API to 
anyone willing to work on them.
