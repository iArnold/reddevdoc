Difference between a native and an action

Explained by BrianH:

A native is pretty much called directly, maybe a little argument 
marshalling but that's it. An action dispatches to a handler associated 
with the type of the first argument, one of a table of such handlers. 
The action itself doesn't do much - everything is done by the handler.

Adding more actions makes it more difficult to implement datatypes. 
That is why R3 has fewer actions than R2, why some former actions 
are now natives.

Doc introduced native and action tables on 26 december 2012:

I didn't need native/action tables until now, the interpreter made 
me add them sooner than I planned. Extending Red with new natives 
is already possible using simply routines. For new dynamically added 
datatypes , it will be soon possible too at Red/System level and 
with an appropriate interface, from Red directly (with routines when 
needed).
