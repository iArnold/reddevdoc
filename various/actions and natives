Difference between a native and an action

Explained by BrianH:

A native is pretty much called directly, maybe a little argument 
marshalling but that's it. An action dispatches to a handler associated 
with the type of the first argument, one of a table of such handlers. 
The action itself doesn't do much - everything is done by the handler.
