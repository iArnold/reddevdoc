===How to test your changes to the source code?

After coding away on the Red source code you want to know if what you did works so you 
can issue a pull request to get your code accepted by the project. This description of what to do 
will presume that you do not have a Rebol SDK license, and you cannot encap the source into a binary like 
the project can.

---Follow these steps

*Download the sourcecode and extract into a folder. 

*Put a Rebol/Core executable for your platform in the main directory. 
(For *Windows* you will need a *Rebol/View* executable.)

*Make sure you make or get your changes in here too. 

*Run the Red testset to confirm there are no regression errors caused by your new code. Open your Rebol console

  do %run-all.r

*Now compile a script that makes use of the changed or added code. 

  do/args %red.r “-c %path/to/testscript.red”

*If your script compiles, test your script.
(If your script does not compile you have to do a "cd .." before recompiling the improved script. 
This is because the directory change will not be reverted after a compilation error in the Red/System compiler step. 
(Lines 348 – 358 of red.r, fail-try function defined in rsc.r))

*If all went well, continue your work or send a pull request to github.com/red/red

Good luck!
