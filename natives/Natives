===Natives

How do natives work?

Native functions are added in Red/System
%runtime/natives.reds

Native functions definitions are embedded in a context called "natives".
Native functions have an asterisk added. 

Context natives comes with its own helper functions.

New native functions are to added before these helper functions.

At the end the new native function must be enlisted within the init function.

To make use of the new native function the new enum for the function must be added to 
%runtime\macros.reds

Now the native function can be added to 
%environment\natives.red

Here as an example WHILE
  while: make native! [[
  		"Evaluates body as long as condition block returns TRUE"
  		cond [block!]	"Condition block to evaluate on each iteration"
  		body [block!]	"Block to evaluate on each iteration"
  	]
  	#get-definition NAT_WHILE
  ]

Notice there is a line
  #define NATIVES_NB		100							;-- max number of natives (arbitrary set)

Be sure to not add the 101st native function ;-)


That is about all it takes, but beware, things are pretty precise at the low level (bytes are not integers, pointers mut be of correct type etc).
