How does the stack work?

###

Understanding the stack is an important part of understanding how certain parts of Red work.

A stack is a portion of memory dedicated to keep trackof which value to use for the series of programstep that must be
performed to make your program do what you want it to do.

To help do the bookkeeping for the program there are stacks where the computer can store variables.

In Red the stack and stac functions are defined in the stack.reds file.

Most important functions of the stack are push* push and pop.
