===Frequently Asked Questions

As a general remark it should be stated that it is a good idea to keep a Rebol console at hand when reading the source code.

Q:  Why then is assert (re?)defined in 5 different places in the source code?
Answer: In system/compiler.r the function comp-assert is defined
In quick-test/quick-test.red and quick-test/quick-test.reds the function --assert is defined
It is redefined because of extra functionality and because it also must be possible to run the tests independent of
each other.

---Function definition with set

Q:  Why are some functions defined using "set 'fname" instead of "fname:"?
Answer: In int-to-bin.r in system/utils a function to-bin32 is defined like this.

===Diverse Questions

---to

Q:  Why is it to-hex and to integer! and why don't you use to-integer, that function exists too?
Answer: Because to-integer is defined to be a function that does the to integer! casting. Otoh to-hex is a 
native function that does not have a to hex! equivalent.
