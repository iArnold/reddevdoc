===Frequently Asked Questions

As a general remark it should be stated that it is a good idea to keep a Rebol console at hand when reading the source code.

--The rsc.r script

Q:  What is this rsc.r script about?
Answer: This is the old compilation script wrapper for Red/System programs. It is still being kept around, 
maybe one day it can serve another purpose.

---Assert

Q:  What are all these asserts about?
Answer:  While assert is not on the documentation page http://www.rebol.com/docs/dictionary.html it is known in Rebol.
This description is shown when help is used:
? assert  
USAGE:
    ASSERT conditions /type

DESCRIPTION:
     Assert that condition is true, else throw an assertion error.
     ASSERT is a function value.

ARGUMENTS:
     conditions -- (Type: block)

REFINEMENTS:
     /type -- Safely check datatypes of variables (words)

(SPECIAL ATTRIBUTES)
     catch
     throw

Q:  Why then is assert (re?)defined in 5 different places in the source code?
Answer: In system/compiler.r the function comp-assert is defined
In quick-test/quick-test.red and quick-test/quick-test.reds the function --assert is defined
It is redefined because of extra functionality and because it also must be possible to run the tests independent of
each other.

---Function definition with set

Q:  Why are some functions defined using "set 'fname" instead of "fname:"?
Answer: In int-to-bin.r in system/utils a function to-bin32 is defined like this.

===Diverse Questions

---to

Q:  Why is it to-hex and to integer! and why don't you use to-integer, that function exists too?
Answer: Because to-integer is defined to be a function that does the to integer! casting. Otoh to-hex is a 
native function that does not have a to hex! equivalent.

Q:  Why do you need to use Rebol/View to run the tests on Windows?
Answer: (By Peter W.A. Wood) Rebol/View is needed to run the tests under Windows as it uses Nenad's call.r 
due to the bugs in Rebol's call in 2.7.8. This involves linking to a library which is not supported in Rebol/Core.

Q:  Will the quick-test documents for Red be updated soon? I saw some typo's in the docs, shall I fix them?
Answer: (By Peter W.A. Wood) I am in the process of updating the Quick-Test documents so don't worry about any 
typos just yet. There'll no doubt be plenty for you to find later :-)
