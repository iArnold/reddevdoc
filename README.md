reddevdoc
=========

Red development starting documentation.

Because very few people are actually contributing to the Red source, I decided it was time to put some information in a document to save every new programmer some time in researching the Red sources and give a helping hand in understanding how the Red 
Programming Language sources work together.

You are free to join the effort at its new home: https://github.com/reddoc/develop

Be sure to take a look at the wiki there!
