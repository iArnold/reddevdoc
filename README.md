reddevdoc
=========

Red development starting documentation.

Because very few people are actually contributing to the Red source 
Arnold decided it was time to put some information in a document to save every new programmer 
some time in researching the Red sources and give a helping hand in understanding how the Red 
Programming Language sources work together.

Please feel free to join in this effort.
